# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Purpose

For this project, the goal is to map the latest earthquake data from the US Geological Survey website.

The map features three layers that a user can choose between: street view, satellite view and dark view.

Additionally a user can toggle between any, or all, of the three types of map data: all earthquakes within the last 7 days, tectonic plates, or major earthquakes (with a magnitude greater than 4).

## Process

Acquire data

## Tools & Languages

* HTML
* JavaScript
* JSON
* Plotly

## Analysis

## Results

The data within the map can be displayed in various ways. At any time, only 1 map style can show (street, satellite, or dark), but any of the map data can be turned on (all earthquakes, tectonic plates, or major earthquakes).

Here are a few possible views of the map:

### Street view with all earthquake data

### Satellite view with tectonic plate data

### Dark view with major earthquake data
